# RNN-LSTM-NLP-Sentiment-analysis

For this project, I used the Clothing, Shoes, and Jewelry dataset to build a model for predicting customer sentiment. 

The model classifies reviews into two categories: "like" for 4 or 5-star ratings, and "dislike" for 1 or 2-star ratings. 

The model is based on LSTM using text data.
